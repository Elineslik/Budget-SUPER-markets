                <p>‘I am studying Journalism and Communication, a bachelor’s programme at the University of Helsinki.
                    Usually, journalism is very practical, but because it’s a university degree there is a strong focus
                    on
                    research. My studies are in Swedish, because I belong to the Swedish speaking minority in Finland.
                    At
                    home we speak both Finnish and Swedish, so I speak both languages equally well.
                </p>

                <p> am currently doing a
                    minor programme in International Journalism at the AUAS. It is much more practical than what I am
                    used
                    to. We have to write so many articles, which is good because it has helped me improve my English so
                    much, having to write in English almost every day and talking too.
                </p>

                <p>visited Amsterdam for the first
                    time in 2015, and I enjoyed it a lot. I heard from others that it’s nice to study here. At first, I
                    was
                    a bit hesitant, because the application process is a lot of work. But then I started researching and
                    the
                    idea grew into a decision that I am incredibly happy with. I have always been interested in going
                    abroad. When I was in ninth grade, I went to Germany for one month. I also worked abroad for a few
                    summers in Denmark. You can build your own identity again when living in other countries.’
                </p>

                <h5>The Amsterdam way </h5>
                <p>‘I live in Diemen, but I wish I lived closer to the city centre. I cycle everywhere because I want
                    to do it the Amsterdam way. I like how easy it is to get around by bike, I am not used to that. At
                    first, I was a bit afraid of the traffic, but if you are careful enough it is fine. The Dutch
                    language
                    sounds made-up or as if someone is talking backwards, I am sorry Dutchies but it does. The
                    supermarkets
                    in my opinion are cheap, because Finland is extremely expensive. The people here are very direct,
                    but I
                    am also used to being direct. Most other students in my class are open, so it is easy to get to know
                    people.’
                </p>

                <h2> "I cycle everywhere, because I want to do it the Amsterdam way."</h2>

                <h5>The international lifestyle </h5>
                <p>'I enjoy the night life. There is always something happening
                    somewhere. My favourite place to go is Skatecafé. At the beginning of the semester I changed my
                    minor,
                    so it took me a while to get to know the people in my class, but this was the first time I hung out
                    with
                    them. We had a pre-party and then we went out to the Skatecafé., which was a lot of fun.
                </p>

                <p>About budgeting tips, I would say: make your food at home. Also, go cycling. Renting a Swapfiets
                    doesn’t
                    cost that much,
                    and you get free exercise and a moment to clear your mind after a long day. Another tip is that you
                    must
                    remind yourself that you are going to have bad days and good days. Also, just say yes to everything.
                    You
                    are going to meet many people that way.
                </p>

                <p>I'm graduating after this and this is the first time in my life
                    that I do not have a plan, which is freeing and scary. I either want to go travelling or backpacking
                    in
                    Asia or move to Sweden and work there. Studying something creative or moving to Germany and learning
                    the
                    language properly is on my list too. In the end, we will see what I will do.’

            </ul>
            <div>
                <p>‘I am from Berlin, where I study International Business. I have quite a lot of international
                    experience.
                    Before my exchange semester in Amsterdam, I also did one in Mexico which took six months. Also, I’ve
                    done an internship in Luxembourg. I’ve always had the desire to study abroad. Whenever I get the
                    chance,
                    I pack my stuff and leave. Now I’m not following a specific minor programme. My specialisation is
                    marketing, so I’m taking some economic and business classes.
                </p>

                <p>I moved to Amsterdam at the end of January,
                    so I’ve been here a solid three months now. I’ve been to Amsterdam before though, during an
                    Interrail
                    trip that is popular among the Berlin students. I spent four days in Amsterdam and liked it a lot.
                    After
                    studying in Mexico, I wanted to go back to Europe because I wanted to be closer to my family. I
                    chose
                    Amsterdam as my next study destination because it is in the heart of Europe, it’s easy to travel to
                    many
                    countries from here.’
                </p>

                <h5>Diemen, the place to be </h5>
                <p>‘At the moment I live in a big student complex in Diemen.
                    A lot of other international students live here. It wasn’t my first choice, but I understand the
                    current
                    housing situation in Amsterdam is not the best. The positive side of living in a complex like this
                    is
                    you can relate to the other internationals because you’re all in the same boat. It’s also cheaper
                    than
                    living in the city centre. However, it could take a bit away from the whole experience of
                    surrounding
                    yourself with the Dutch population.’
                </p>

                <h2>"First things first: get yourself a bike! Also,
                    buy your own drinks and organise your own parties."</h2>

                <h5>Get that bike!</h5>
                <p>‘One of the first things I noticed in Amsterdam is
                    how expensive everything is. Especially public transport. It is well organised, but as an
                    international
                    student who isn’t staying very long, there is no discount card. I would highly recommend getting
                    yourself a bike to get around the city cheap and fast. Amsterdam is not that huge, so it’s easy to
                    get
                    around. Even on rainy days, just accept it and jump on your bike, just like the Dutch do.’
                </p>

                <h5>The Dutch know their English well </h5>
                <p>‘Another thing I discovered is that Dutch people are very good at English. Out
                    of all the countries I’ve visited, the Dutch are by far the best English-speaking population. Even
                    the
                    older generations directly switch to English if they discover you don’t speak Dutch. I sometimes
                    find it
                    easier to understand Dutch people speaking English than English people themselves. When I visited
                    Manchester in the UK, the accents were sometimes very varied and hard to understand.’
                </p>

                <h5>Study hotspots </h5>
                <p>‘I would really recommend CREA on the Nieuwe Achtergracht. It’s a nice, inspiring place to study at.
                    A
                    lot
                    of my classmates also like the OBA, the big library near Central Station. Apart from that I just
                    really
                    like hanging out in the city centre, I think it’s beautiful and it’s fun to give tours to my friends
                    who
                    visit regularly.’

            </ul>
            <div>
                <p>I have always been fascinated with studying abroad and the choice to start studying in Amsterdam came
                    to
                    mind in 2017. It was my mum who came up with the idea of studying here because she read online that
                    Amsterdam is a welcoming city for internationals and has affordable study programmes. There was no
                    connection to The Netherlands before that and it was only in that moment that this small country
                    suddenly appeared as an option.
                </p>

                <p>choice to study abroad was influenced by my parents. My mum has one
                    big rule in her life; she wanted her daughter to learn the English language, even though she
                    couldn’t
                    speak it herself. She wanted her daughter to learn to make my world the biggest it could be and this
                    really encouraged me to see no boundaries in where I could go.
                </p>

                <p>Recently, I moved to the city centre with
                    a friend, there is a heavy rent with this so I also started working. I am sharing the house together
                    with three different people, nationalities and circumstances and it makes me feel that my world is
                    big.
                    When I need it I can get some alone time, which is also important to reload and get my own routine
                    going.’
                </p>

                <h5>Comparisons and expectations </h5>
                <p>‘Compared to my experience in Korea, where all the buildings are
                    tall and grey, the city of Amsterdam almost felt like a maze. As a fashion student, I was impressed
                    by
                    all the different outfits from pedestrians and tourists. From a Korean perspective that is not a
                    normal
                    thing to see. Everybody wears what they want to, and people are okay with it, something I really
                    applaud
                    as a fashion student. It was quite shocking that the Dutch people were nice but at the same time
                    direct.
                    Through my study, I realised that Dutch students have more optimistic viewpoints on the process of
                    work.
                    They are way more open about their struggles, they will keep on searching for a solution.
                </p>

                <p>I thought the city was so beautiful and romantic, that I could call it my home. But I really started
                    to
                    feel at home
                    when I started working and mixing with Dutch people. When you go up to them and even try to speak
                    the
                    language, they are always open to help. They also express mutual interest, even if it is in a small
                    way
                    like asking me ‘what are you studying’ it makes me feel so welcome.
                </p>

                <h2>"I already feel so welcome in Amsterdam."</h2>
                <p>Biking is the ultimate Dutch thing
                    for sure. But what I think is super Dutch is the self-scan system at the supermarket. I couldn’t
                    believe
                    that they just let people scan stuff by themselves and then walk out. The Dutch also have a lot of
                    fried
                    food, the sweet potatoes with truffle mayonnaise are definitely my favourite. But honestly,
                    Amsterdam’s
                    food is so varied, and every culture is represented and I think that is an iconic character of the
                    Dutch
                    cuisine.’
                </p>

                <h5>Budget tips </h5>
                <p>‘My budget tip is selling vintage clothes as well as buying them. Amsterdam has a
                    lot of second-hand stores and flea markets where you can find nice things. Also, try to cook at home
                    sometimes, it is way cheaper, and you can save small portions for later. And my tip for any
                    international student is to just take your time with speaking English and don’t hesitate to ask for
                    some
                    clarification when necessary. People don’t mind.
                </p>

                <p>After my study, I am open to exploring more of the
                    world or even studying somewhere else abroad as well. But when I think of Amsterdam, this could
                    definitely be a place I would come back to and grow old. Changing the city you live in makes you
                    grow so
                    much as a person and I am open to explore more.’

                However, I didn’t have a specific city in my mind. But when I went to Amsterdam, I immediately got
                attracted by the big European capital with its bike culture, the canals, the greenness, and it was a

                that is familiar to me. I do live with other international students, in Diemen, which makes the studying
                abroad experience awesome. I found the place with the help of my university, so I didn't have to
                struggle at all. Living in this enormous city gave me this favourite memory of me and two other
                international guys. We would spend a lot of time sitting next to the canal at our favourite spot near
                the NEMO Science Museum listening to music, having beers, dancing, singing, laughing, and playing
                football. Those moments summarise my experience of studying in Amsterdam. It is interesting to think
                about how I didn't know anything about Amsterdam when I arrived. Now that I know a lot of people, I can
                say that the city feels familiar to me.’

            <h5> vs French Culture </h5>
            <p>‘When it comes to the Dutch culture,
                several things stood out to me, other than the fact that the people are tall. One of them is that here,
                you call the lecturers by their first names. In France you would never do that. Instead, we call them
                sir or madam. The second one, which also happens at university, is that you can go to the bathroom
                whenever you want to without asking for permission. In France you would have to raise your hand,
                otherwise it can come off as rude. Just like eating snacks in class, in the Netherlands, it's completely
                normal which feels odd to me. What I have noticed is that the relationship between students and teachers
                is based on trust, which I do like. And the last one is that during New Year's Eve, I noticed that Dutch
                people rather do cool drinking games instead of dancing during parties.’

            <h5>Budget & Café Tips</h5>
            <p>‘For any new
                international student who decides to study in Amsterdam, I would recommend getting a bonus card from
                Albert Heijn. You can save a lot of money using that card to buy groceries. Febo is a nice and easy
                place to grab food, especially to grab a broodje kroket with mustard. For bikes, check out Swapfiets as
                they are good too. To hang out with friends I would suggest visiting Skatecafé in North and Coco’s
                Outback at Thorbeckeplein to watch football while having drinks. And if you have time left, make sure to
                organise a boat tour on the canal with friends! I would love to live a part of my life in Amsterdam. My
                friend and I agreed on coming back to Amsterdam to spend one week together. I would still love to see an
                Ajax game, but it is so hard and expensive to get tickets.’
